### F A Q
What's the best mechanical keyboard?
```
There's no right answer!
It's all a matter of personal preference.
```
What is a holy panda?
```
It's a Frankenstein switch.
```
What is a 1800 keyboard layout?
```
1800-Compact is an alternative full-size 
layout that has the same number of keys 
as a full-size keyboard in a slightly 
more compact arrangement. Here, the arrow 
keys are squished below the Enter key, 
while the other navigational keys go above 
the number pad.
```
